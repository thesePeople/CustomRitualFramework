# CustomRitualFramework
A mod for the game Rimworld that adds a framework for adding new custom Ideological Rituals

Adds four attachable ritual outcomes: Ensure Bountiful Harvest, Manna from Heaven, Gambler's Prayer, and Random Buff Per Pawn. Also adds two new rituals - Ideoligious Service and Cure Disease

Originally envisioned to support rituals that ensure bountiful harvests and call manna from heaven, I quickly wanted to make those more generic and so provided a framework through which it is relatively easy to add additional RitualAttachableOutcomeEffects. This grew out from that, adding similar functionality to RitualOutcomeEffects for defining new rituals, and then eventually expanding to add other new classes and modExtensions to support further customization of new rituals. It has become a general Custom Ritual Framework.

Most of the Attachable Outcomes and both of the new Rituals are used to showcase the features and as examples. The XML files for them have been commented as a kind of tutorial in creating new outcomes and new rituals in general. Some of the newer items are not well documented (currently more or less only in the change notes, below), but ideally I'll work on that.

I'm considering renaming the entire mod to Custom Ritual Framework, or CRF, but I may keep the namespace the old legacy thing so as not to mess up too much if you've been using this to define your own rituals. I'm also considering uploading a new version under the new name, but I'm not sure of the best approach. Let me know what you think!
